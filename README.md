## 1️⃣ Secure Notes App (Security-Focused Development)

**Tech Stack:**

* .NET MAUI (C#)
* Argon2id password hashing
* AES-256-GCM encryption
* SQLite database
* MVVM architecture pattern
* Visual Studio 2022
* GitHub

**Project Type:**
Personal portfolio project demonstrating enterprise-level security implementation for cross-platform mobile applications.

**Overview:**
Built a production-ready note-taking application with a focus on **zero-knowledge architecture** and **military-grade encryption**. The app ensures that all sensitive data is encrypted client-side before storage, meaning even database compromise cannot expose user information.

This project was specifically designed to showcase security best practices relevant to federal technology and DevSecOps roles.

**Key Security Features:**

* **Argon2id Password Hashing**: OWASP-recommended algorithm resistant to GPU cracking attacks
* **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Authenticated encryption for all note data with tamper detection
* **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server/database never has access to plaintext data
* **Secure Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 implementation for cryptographic key generation
* **Biometric Authentication**: Device-level security integration (fingerprint/face recognition)

**Technical Highlights:**

* Cross-platform deployment (Windows, Android, iOS, macOS)
* Secure local database with SQLite encryption
* Clean MVVM pattern for maintainable code
* Input validation and error handling
* Offline-first architecture with data persistence

**Skills Demonstrated:**

✔ Enterprise security implementation (encryption, hashing, key management)
✔ Cross-platform mobile development
✔ Secure coding practices for sensitive data
✔ Architectural design patterns (MVVM, zero-knowledge)
✔ Version control with GitHub

## 2️⃣ AI-Powered Internal Workflow Automation (Internship Project)

**Tech & Tools:**

* n8n (workflow automation)
* SQL queries
* HTTP requests
* Vapi (AI chat models)
* Internal system APIs

**Overview:**
As part of an ongoing digital transformation effort, I contributed to building automated workflows in **n8n** to help leadership derive business insights faster. These workflows combine SQL data extraction, HTTP API calls, and AI-powered responses using Vapi.

The result is an internal AI assistant that executive leaders can interact with directly, asking questions about the business and receiving timely, accurate responses.

**Examples of workflow capabilities:**

* Automatically query internal systems
* Generate reports and summaries
* Pull real-time operational data
* Format data into decision-ready responses
* Provide results inside an AI chat interface

**Impact:**

✔ Leadership can retrieve actionable insights in seconds
✔ Less manual report generation
✔ Improved speed and confidence in decision-making
✔ Demonstrated automation benefits across multiple business functions

## 3️⃣ My Digital Business Card (Entrepreneurship Team Project)

**Tech Stack:**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* VS Code
* GitHub (collaboration)
* Vercel (deployment)

**Project Type:**
Rapid MVP development for a live entrepreneurship competition, pitched in front of students, professors, and local business professionals.

**Overview:**
Three team members and I rapidly designed and built a working mobile web application called **My Digital Business Card**, aimed at modernizing professional networking.

**Key Features:**

* Interactive digital business card UI
* Tap-to-flip animation revealing:

  * Profile photo
  * Name
  * Role
  * Email, phone, LinkedIn
  * Portfolio links
* Personal settings screen:

  * Update profile images
  * Edit all user information
  * Add resume links
  * Customize card and background colors
* "My Collections" tab to:

  * Store your own card
  * Save cards of other users for fast lookup

**Skills Gained:**

✔ MVP planning and development
✔ UI/UX design
✔ GitHub-based collaboration
✔ Real deployment using Vercel
✔ Live product pitching

## 4️⃣ Data Cleaning & Process Improvement (Internship Project)

**Tech & Tools:**

* ADDs E3 (Energy/Fuel back-office system)
* SQL querying
* Excel
* Business & customer communication
* Executive/leadership reporting

**Overview:**
During my internship, I worked directly with company operational data stored in ADDs E3. I developed targeted SQL queries to extract system data into Excel for cleaning and analysis.

To resolve missing or incomplete information, I coordinated with customers and internal stakeholders, clarifying and updating system records to improve data accuracy and reliability.

**Outcome & Impact:**
I delivered a presentation to the Executive Leadership Team summarizing:

* Data quality issues and inefficiencies identified
* System corrections completed
* Recommendations for process improvements
* Expected operational benefits and efficiency gains

**Skills Strengthened:**

✔ Business data analysis
✔ SQL development
✔ Data cleansing and validation
✔ Presenting technical work to non-technical leadership
